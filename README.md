# DeFi World: An Autonomous Realm of Encrypted Game Assets 🏰

DeFi World is a revolutionary platform that combines the thrill of role-playing games (RPGs) with decentralized finance (DeFi), where every game asset is powered by **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology**. Here, players engage in a whimsical fantasy world where their game items reflect real DeFi positions, allowing them to explore, strategize, and profit—all while maintaining the utmost security and confidentiality of their financial standings.

## Problem Statement: Bridging Gaming and Finance 🎮💰

In the rapidly evolving landscape of DeFi, users often face a bewildering array of complex financial instruments and strategies that can be intimidating and inaccessible. Many gamers perceive DeFi as a dry, complicated realm, far removed from the immersive worlds they love. This disconnection prevents a wider audience from utilizing DeFi benefits, and it keeps potential wealth from being actively engaged within the gaming sphere.

## The FHE Solution: Security Meets Fun 🔒✨

DeFi World bridges this gap by encapsulating DeFi assets within engaging game mechanics, allowing players to interact with financial instruments in an intuitive way. By applying **Fully Homomorphic Encryption** via Zama's open-source libraries, we ensure that:

1. **Player Data Remains Private**: Each asset's underlying potential value can be tracked and traded without exposing sensitive information, removing the fear of data breaches.
2. **Dynamic Asset Attributes**: The characteristics of game items (like a "magic sword" representing a deposit on Aave) can automatically adjust based on the performance of the underlying DeFi protocols—offering a live experience affected by real financial markets.
3. **User Engagement**: Complex DeFi mechanics are abstracted into enjoyable gameplay, making finance fun and interactive.

Our implementation utilizes the **Concrete** library, which enables seamless integration of encrypted computation in our game logic, allowing for real-time updates of asset attributes while maintaining maximum confidentiality.

## Key Features 🌟

- **Fantasy RPG Elements**: Dynamic game assets such as weapons, potions, and armor represent actual DeFi positions.
- **Real-time Asset Upgrades**: Players can see their items evolve based on the performance of linked DeFi protocols.
- **Educational Gameplay**: Intuitive mechanics designed to teach players about DeFi in an engaging, hands-on manner.
- **Secure Transactions**: All financial interactions are encrypted, ensuring player safety and privacy.

## Technology Stack 🛠️

- **Zama FHE SDK**: The core component enabling confidential and secure computations.
- **Node.js**: Environment for executing JavaScript server-side.
- **Hardhat**: A framework for Ethereum development, including smart contract management.
- **Solidity**: Used for writing smart contracts deployed on Ethereum.
- **React**: For building the user interface and enhancing the gaming experience.

## Installation Guide 🛠️

To set up the DeFi World project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Your Environment is Ready**: You need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you haven't yet done so, please download and install the latest version from the official Node.js website.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project folder in your terminal and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This command will install all necessary dependencies, including the Zama FHE libraries required for the project to function properly.

**Important**: Do not use `git clone` or any repository URLs to obtain this project.

## Build & Run Guide 🚀

After successfully installing the dependencies, you are ready to build and run the DeFi World project. Here are the commands you need:

1. **Compile Smart Contracts**: To compile the smart contracts, run:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run Tests**: Ensure everything is functioning correctly by executing:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Deploy the Contract**: To deploy the contract to a local Ethereum network, execute:

   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

4. **Start the Application**: Finally, you can start the application by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage Example ⚔️

Here’s a brief code snippet demonstrating how to retrieve the attributes of a game asset linked to a DeFi position:

```javascript
const { getAssetAttributes } = require('./src/utils');

async function main() {
    const assetId = 'magic_sword_Aave';
    const attributes = await getAssetAttributes(assetId);
    console.log(`The current attack power of ${assetId} is: ${attributes.attackPower}`);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

This function fetches the current attributes of a game asset, which updates dynamically based on the underlying DeFi investment performance.
